1. Scroll to: **Build & Deploy** section
2. Find: **Build Command** field
3. **Replace** the current command with:
   ```bash
   cd backend/services/matching-service && npm install && npm run build
   ```
4. Click: **Save Changes**

### Step 3: Manual Deploy
1. Go to: **Manual Deploy** section (top of page)
2. Click: **Deploy latest commit** button

## ✅ After Fix

The matching service should build successfully and you'll see:
```
✅ npm install - completed
✅ npm run build - completed
✅ tsc compilation successful
✅ Service starting...
```

Then test:
```bash
curl https://staff-matching-service.onrender.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "matching-service",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## 🔍 Check Other Services Too

While you're in the dashboard, verify the build commands for all services are correct:

### Correct Format:
```bash
cd backend/services/[SERVICE-NAME] && npm install && npm run build
```

### Services to Check:
- ✅ auth-service (already working)
- ✅ user-service (already working)
- 🔧 matching-service (fix this one)
- ⏳ communication-service (verify build command)
- ⏳ notification-service (verify build command)

- ✅ JWT_SECRET

- ✅ JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
