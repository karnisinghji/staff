# 🚀 Environment Variables Added - Manual Redeploy Required

## ✅ Environment Variables Configured

You've successfully added all 8 environment variables to all 5 services:

```env
✅ NODE_ENV=production
✅ PORT=10000
✅ DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_AwN7nqtQOs8P@ep-proud-dew-adi1wdgd-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
✅ JWT_SECRET=contractor-worker-platform-super-secret-key-2025
✅ JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
✅ JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
✅ CORS_ORIGIN=https://karnisinghji.github.io
✅ ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://karnisinghji.github.io,http://localhost:5173
```

## 🔄 CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Manual Redeploy

**Issue**: Services haven't restarted yet to pick up the new environment variables

**Solution**: You need to **manually trigger a redeploy** for each service:

### **Manual Redeploy Steps:**

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com/

2. **For each service**, click the service name and then:
   - Click **"Manual Deploy"** button (usually at top right)
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for redeploy to complete
   - Look for "Your service is live 🎉" message

3. **Services to manually redeploy:**
   - ✅ staff-auth-service-gsg3
   - ✅ staff-user-service
   - ✅ staff-matching-service
   - ✅ staff-communication-service-cdqt
   - ✅ staff-notification-service

### **Expected Results After Manual Redeploy:**

Once all services have been manually redeployed:

```bash
# This should work perfectly:
curl -X POST https://staff-auth-service-gsg3.onrender.com/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"testuser@example.com","password":"Test123!","roles":["worker"]}'

# Expected Response:
# {"success":true,"user":{"id":"...","email":"testuser@example.com",...}}
```

## ⏰ Timeline

- **Next 10-15 minutes**: Manual redeploy all 5 services
- **After redeploys**: Test registration (should work!)
- **Then**: Test full application flow
- **Finally**: Build Android APK

**You're almost there!** Just need the manual redeploys to activate the environment variables! 🚀
