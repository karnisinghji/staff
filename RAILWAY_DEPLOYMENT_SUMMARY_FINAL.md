## ⚠️ Next Step: Configure Environment Variables

### Quick Setup (Railway CLI):
```bash
# Navigate to each service and set env vars
cd backend/services/user-service
railway variables --set JWT_SECRET=<your-secret>
railway variables --set DATABASE_URL=<neon-postgres-url>
railway variables --set PORT=8080
railway variables --set NODE_ENV=production

# Repeat for other services (matching, communication, notification)
```

### Or Via Railway Dashboard:
1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Select each service project
3. Click "Variables" tab
4. Add required variables (see RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md for details)
5. Railway will auto-redeploy with new variables
