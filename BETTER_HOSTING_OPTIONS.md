## 💡 **Immediate Solution: Auto-Wake Service**

I can set up a simple script that pings your services every 10 minutes to keep them awake:

```bash
# Cron job that runs every 10 minutes
*/10 * * * * curl -s https://staff-matching-service.onrender.com/health
*/10 * * * * curl -s https://staff-communication-service-cdqt.onrender.com/health  
*/10 * * * * curl -s https://staff-notification-service.onrender.com/health
```

## 🎯 **What I Recommend:**

**For Free:** **Auto-wake script** + current setup - Works but has minor delays
