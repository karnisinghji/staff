# TypeScript Project References Report

Date: 2025-09-29

## Summary
We introduced a composite TypeScript build using a root solution `backend/tsconfig.json` that references each service plus the shared library. This enables incremental builds, faster type checking, and stricter dependency boundaries across services.

## Goals Achieved
- Single command `npx tsc -b` now builds all backend services in topological order.
- Shared types compiled once and consumed by dependents.
- Service `tsconfig.json` files simplified via `extends` of `../../tsconfig.base.json`.
- Enabled `composite` for proper `.tsbuildinfo` artifacts and incremental correctness.
- Centralized compiler options (target, module, strict flags, moduleResolution, esModuleInterop) in `tsconfig.base.json`.

## Structure
```
backend/
  tsconfig.json (solution)
  tsconfig.base.json (base options)
  services/
    shared/
      tsconfig.json (composite lib)
    auth-service/
      tsconfig.json (references ../shared)
    user-service/
    communication-service/
    notification-service/
    matching-service/
```

## Key Decisions
| Area | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Base Config | `tsconfig.base.json` with strict + interop | Consistency & DRY |
| References | Each service references `../shared` only | Enforces layered dependency graph |
| Build Command | `tsc -b` solution style | Deterministic graph build |
| Emission | Per-service `dist/` | Keeps Docker layering & deployment simple |
| Imports | Namespace import for `winston`, `prom-client` | Align with `esModuleInterop` correctness |

## Benefits
1. Incremental builds reduce local iteration time (unchanged services are skipped).
2. Early detection of cross-service type breakages at compile time.
3. Clear dependency boundaries limit accidental tight coupling.
4. Simplified CI pipeline: one compile step vs N serial steps.
5. Foundation for future tooling (project references unlock language server perf improvements).

## Operational Impact
- CI can cache each service's `dist` + `.tsbuildinfo` keyed by its source hash.
- Deploy pipelines may choose selective build packaging (only impacted services) with a graph diff.
- Facilitates future migration to a monorepo task runner (e.g., Nx, Turborepo, Lage) if desired.

## Follow-Up Opportunities
| Priority | Item | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| High | Add lint pipeline using shared ESLint config | Ensure consistent code quality gates |
| Medium | Add path aliases (e.g., `@shared/*`) only at compile-time | Consider after adding strict boundaries doc |
| Medium | Generate dependency graph visualization | Use `tsc --showConfig` or 3rd-party tool |
| Low | Evaluate build orchestration tool | Optional; only if complexity grows |

## Validation
Latest run: `npx tsc -b` exited with code 0 (no errors). Issues previously encountered (missing `prom-client`, incorrect shared extends path, default import of `winston`) have been resolved.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Hidden transitive coupling via runtime imports | Runtime-only drift from compile graph | Enforce review on dynamic `require` usage |
| Divergent compiler options reintroduced | Inconsistent builds | Keep strict code review for tsconfig edits |
| Service referencing another service directly | Architectural erosion | Add ADR & lint rule (import path boundary) |

## Next Steps
1. Produce `PRODUCTION-READINESS.md` summarizing remaining gaps.
2. Add Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.prod.yml` leveraging incremental build outputs.
3. Document `/health` & `/metrics` contracts (names, types, SLIs).
4. Introduce CI caching of `.tsbuildinfo` per service.
