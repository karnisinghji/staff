# Production Readiness Report
Date: 2025-09-30 (updated)

## Scope
Backend microservices (auth, user, communication, notification, matching) plus shared library and frontend (React/Vite). Focus: deployability, operability, reliability, observability, security, performance basics.

## Readiness Matrix
| Pillar | Status | Summary |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Build & Artifacts | GREEN | Deterministic `tsc -b` composite build working; per-service `dist/` outputs. |
| Configuration | GREEN | `.env.example` present backend & frontend; NODE_ENV honored via `start:prod`. |
| Logging | YELLOW | Structured logger with requestId correlation in place; env-driven LOG_LEVEL & format doc pending. |
| Metrics & Health | GREEN | Standard `/metrics` + `/health`; readiness layer (`/ready`) added; formal contract doc still pending. |
| Testing | YELLOW | Jest present; coverage gates & broader integration tests still needed. |
| Security | YELLOW | Helmet + rate limiting applied platform-wide; shared security helper; dependency scan & secrets hardening pending. |
| Deployment (Containers) | GREEN | Dockerfiles + compose present (initial implementation). |
| Observability (Tracing) | RED | No distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) yet. |
| CI/CD | GREEN | GitHub Actions pipeline: build, typecheck, test, lint (matrix), docker build. Vulnerability scan pending. |
| Documentation | YELLOW | Production readiness updated; observability & runbook additions pending. |
| Resilience | YELLOW | Graceful shutdown implemented; no retry/circuit breaker patterns yet. |
| Performance | GRAY | No load testing baseline or perf budget established. |

Legend: GREEN (sufficient), YELLOW (acceptable gap), RED (blocking gap), GRAY (not yet evaluated).

## Completed Foundations
- Monorepo composite TypeScript build with project references.
- Standardized service scripts: build, start, start:prod.
- Shared observability utilities (metrics, health payload factory, logger wrapper).
- Root structure rationalized; legacy gateway archived & documented.
- Environment variable scaffolding in place.

## Recent Improvements (Since Previous Revision)
1. Platform-wide security hardening via shared `applyStandardSecurity` (helmet + rate limit).
2. Readiness endpoints (`/ready`) added to all services (env + warmup gate).
3. Shared validation helper (zod) introduced; exemplar applied to user-service contacts route.
4. Request correlation IDs in logger across services.
5. Graceful shutdown helper integrated into all services.
6. CI pipeline enhanced with lint matrix and aggregate backend lint.
7. Production readiness document updated to reflect current state.

## Immediate Gaps (Top Priority)
1. Vulnerability & dependency scanning (Trivy/Snyk) integration in CI.
2. Health & metrics contract / OBSERVABILITY doc expansion (SLIs, alert suggestions).
3. Logging format & LOG_LEVEL env standardization (JSON schema doc).
4. Input validation rollout beyond exemplar routes (full coverage of mutating endpoints).
5. Tracing instrumentation (OpenTelemetry) for inter-service calls.
6. Coverage thresholds & expanded integration tests (auth flows, error paths).

## Suggested 7-Day Iteration Plan (Current State Forward)
| Day | Focus | Deliverables |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Vulnerability Scanning | Trivy CI job (fail on HIGH/CRITICAL), Dependabot config draft. |
| 2 | Logging Standardization | LOG_LEVEL support, structured log schema doc, sample Kibana queries. |
| 3 | Validation Coverage | Apply shared validation helper to all create/update endpoints across services. |
| 4 | Observability Contract | `OBSERVABILITY.md` with metrics catalog & SLI definitions. |
| 5 | Tracing Foundation | OpenTelemetry SDK wiring (Express middleware + propagators). |
| 6 | Test Hardening | Coverage thresholds + additional integration tests. |
| 7 | Resilience Patterns | Add timeout wrappers & retry/backoff utility, document usage. |

## Deployment Assumptions
- Each service packaged independently (no shared runtime container) for clear scaling boundaries.
- Future ingress / API gateway handled via external reverse proxy (NGINX/Traefik) or cloud LB.

## Environment Variables (Baseline)
Refer to `.env.example`. Recommended to formalize a typed config module to centralize parsing & validation (e.g., using `zod` or `env-var`).

## Observability Extensions (Future)
| Item | Benefit | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| OpenTelemetry Tracing | Distributed latency & error analysis | Instrument Express + outbound HTTP calls. |
| Log Correlation IDs | Tie logs across services | Inject middleware to add request ID header. |
| SLO Dashboard | Proactive reliability management | Define availability & latency targets. |

## Security Hardening Roadmap (Updated)
1. Vulnerability & dependency scanning (Trivy + Dependabot) in CI.
2. Enforce HTTPS / secure cookies at edge (infra). 
3. Strengthen auth brute-force defenses (incremental backoff, account lockout policy) beyond basic rate limiting.
4. Complete input validation layer coverage using shared zod helper.
5. Secrets management via external vault / secret manager (remove secrets from static env files in prod).
6. Security headers audit & CSP tightening (service-specific needs captured).

## Testing Enhancements
| Layer | Current | Needed |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Unit | Sparse | Add critical domain logic tests. |
| Integration | Minimal | HTTP endpoint tests for auth, health, metrics. |
| Contract | None | Define OpenAPI or schema for inter-service payloads. |
| Performance | None | Light k6 or artillery baseline tests. |
| Resilience | None | Simulate dependency outage & verify graceful behavior. |

## Risk Register (Updated)
| Risk | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| Vulnerabilities unscanned in CI | Open | Add Trivy job (HIGH/CRITICAL fail). |
| Partial validation coverage permits malformed data | Open | Expand shared validator usage. |
| Lack of tracing hides cross-service latency | Open | Introduce OpenTelemetry instrumentation. |
| Log volume / noise without level control | Open | Add LOG_LEVEL env & sampling strategy. |
| Missing retry/backoff may amplify downstream outages | Open | Implement resilience utilities. |
| Secrets in env files risk leakage | Open | Externalize to secret manager. |

## Acceptance Criteria for "Production Ready (Baseline)"
A. Clean composite build + tests pass. (Achieved build; tests baseline pending thresholds.)
B. All services containerized & compose up succeeds locally.
C. Standard health & metrics contract documented & accessible.
D. Security baseline controls: rate limiting, helmet, dependency scan in CI.
E. Structured JSON logging with correlation ID.
F. Graceful shutdown verified.

## Action Checklist (Remaining)
- [ ] Vulnerability scan (Trivy) CI job
- [ ] Dependabot config
- [ ] Logging format update & LOG_LEVEL env
- [ ] Observability contract doc (SLIs, metrics, alert seeds)
- [ ] Validation rollout (all mutating routes)
- [ ] Tracing instrumentation
- [ ] Resilience utilities (timeout, retry, circuit breaker placeholder)
- [ ] Coverage thresholds
- [ ] Optional: k6 baseline performance script

## Conclusion
Substantial progress achieved: security baseline, readiness endpoints, validation pattern, graceful shutdown, and CI linting are in place. Remaining production maturity tasks center on vulnerability scanning, comprehensive validation, tracing, resilience, and formal observability/ logging standards.
