## ⚡ The Fastest Way

### Step 1: Upload to Google Drive (2 minutes)

1. Open this folder on your Mac:
   ```
   /Users/shouryaveersingh/Desktop/old data/staff/frontend/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/
   ```

2. Find file: `app-release.apk` (8.7 MB)

3. Drag it to https://drive.google.com

4. Wait for upload... ⏳ (30 seconds)

### Step 2: Get Shareable Link (1 minute)

1. Right-click the uploaded file in Google Drive

2. Click **"Share"** or **"Get link"**

3. Change from **"Restricted"** to **"Anyone with the link"**

4. Click **"Copy link"**

Your link looks like:
```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abc123DEF456ghi789JKL/view?usp=sharing

Open this file:
```
/Users/shouryaveersingh/Desktop/old data/staff/frontend/src/features/home/HomePage.tsx
```

Find this line (~line 30):
```tsx
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing"
```

Replace `YOUR_FILE_ID` with your actual ID:
```tsx

```

Save the file.

## 💡 Pro Tip: Direct Download Link

Want users to download immediately without Google Drive preview?

Use this format instead:
```tsx
href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1abc123DEF456ghi789JKL"
```

Replace the `id=` part with your File ID.

---

## 🆘 Help

### Can't find File ID?
Your link: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID_HERE/view?usp=sharing`

Example: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K2L3M4N5O6P7Q8R/view?usp=sharing`
File ID = `1K2L3M4N5O6P7Q8R`

### Deployment failed?
Make sure you're in the `frontend` directory:
```bash
cd "/Users/shouryaveersingh/Desktop/old data/staff/frontend"
pwd  # Should show: .../staff/frontend
```

### Link not working?
Check sharing permissions:
1. Open file in Google Drive
2. Click "Share"
3. Must be: "Anyone with the link"
4. Role: "Viewer" is fine
