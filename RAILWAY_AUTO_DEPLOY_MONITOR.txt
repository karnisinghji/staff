I've triggered an auto-deploy by pushing a test file to your repository.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
HOW TO MONITOR THE DEPLOYMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Open Railway Dashboard for each service:
   - auth-service: https://railway.app/project/bb05dc64-069a-4e31-9783-111970652866
   - user-service: https://railway.app/project/14097c18-cc4b-4c7c-9f7b-7292b2cc5d00
   - matching-service: https://railway.app/project/71b37554-46f1-4c59-a6c4-0add8cee20c1
   - communication-service: https://railway.app/project/142eb7a9-e613-4d7f-8dac-f5e95eb45b87
   - notification-service: https://railway.app/project/c4341ba0-1d29-45bc-8320-24c618aed95e

2. For each service:
   - Check the "Deployments" tab
   - Look for the latest deployment with "Auto Deploy" or "GitHub" tag
   - It should show "Building" → "Deploying" → "Live"
   
3. Click on a deployment to see detailed logs:
   - Build logs: npm install and build output
   - Deploy logs: service startup

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
VERIFY THE DEPLOYED SERVICES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After all services show "Live", verify they're working correctly:

1. Check health endpoints:
```bash
curl https://auth-service-production-d5c8.up.railway.app/health
curl https://user-service-production-f141.up.railway.app/health
curl https://matching-service-production.up.railway.app/health
curl https://communication-service-production-c165.up.railway.app/health
curl https://notification-service-production-8738.up.railway.app/health
```

2. Things to verify in each response:
   - Status: 200 OK
   - Version: NOT "unknown" (should show real version)
   - UptimeSeconds: Low number (recently restarted)
   - Service: Correct service name

3. Test the frontend:
   - Visit https://comeondost.web.app
   - Login, browse features
   - Check browser console for any CORS errors

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DEPLOYMENT TIME EXPECTATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- GitHub webhook to Railway: ~30 seconds
- Build time: ~3-5 minutes per service
- Deploy time: ~1-2 minutes per service
- Total time: ~5-10 minutes per service

Services deploy in parallel, so total time should be ~10-15 minutes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TROUBLESHOOTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If a service fails to build/deploy:

1. Check the deployment logs for errors:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Build failures
   - Startup errors

2. Common issues:
   - Root directory not set correctly (should be backend/services/[service])
   - Missing DATABASE_URL or JWT_SECRET env variables
   - Missing build or start commands

3. To fix:
   - Update project settings
   - Fix environment variables
   - Adjust root directory setting
   - Push another commit to trigger a new deploy

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
NEXT STEPS AFTER SUCCESSFUL DEPLOY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Create a summary/documentation:
   - Update RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with new process
   - Document the GitHub Integration setup for team reference

2. Test end-to-end functionality:
   - User registration
   - Login/Auth
   - Profile updates
   - Matching
   - Team requests

3. Consider fixing any remaining issues:
   - Google OAuth redirect URIs
   - WebSocket connections
   - Notification service issues
