## ⚠️ Important: Next Step Required

### You Need to Upload APK to Google Drive

**Why?** Firebase Hosting (free plan) doesn't allow executable files like APKs.

**Solution:** Use Google Drive (free, unlimited for small files)

### Quick Steps:

1. **Upload APK to Google Drive:**
   - Go to https://drive.google.com
   - Upload: `app-release.apk`
   - Right-click → "Get link"
   - Change to: **"Anyone with the link"**
   - Copy the link

2. **Extract File ID from link:**
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abc123xyz456/view?usp=sharing
                                    ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑
                                    This is your File ID
   ```

3. **Update HomePage.tsx:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/shouryaveersingh/Desktop/old data/staff/frontend"
   
   # Edit this file:
   # src/features/home/HomePage.tsx
   # Line ~30
   # Replace: YOUR_FILE_ID
   # With: 1abc123xyz456 (your actual File ID)
   ```

4. **Rebuild and Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```
