# Mobile App Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Message Input Rendering Issue

**Problem:** When typing a message, the emoji button and text box were not rendering properly on mobile screens.

**Root Cause:** Missing mobile-responsive CSS for the message input container, causing layout overflow and poor scaling on small screens.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive mobile CSS breakpoints:
- **@768px**: Adjusted padding (8px 12px), smaller gaps (6px), responsive button sizes (38px)
- **@480px**: Further optimized for small screens - tighter padding (6px 8px), smaller emoji icons (20px), compact send button (36px)
- Added `flex-shrink: 0` to buttons to prevent crushing
- Added `min-width: 0` to input to allow proper flex shrinking
- Set `box-sizing: border-box` for proper width calculations

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/features/messaging/ChatBubble.css` (lines 438-490)

### 2. âœ… Mobile Push Notifications

**Problem:** Users not receiving notifications when someone sends a message or team request, especially when app is in background.

**Root Cause:** 
- No notification system implemented for native mobile app
- WebSocket notifications only work when app is open
- No background service to check for new messages

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive notification system:

#### A. Installed Capacitor Plugins
- `@capacitor/local-notifications@7.0.3` - Local notification display
- `@capacitor/push-notifications@7.0.3` - Push notification support (for future FCM integration)
- `@capacitor/preferences@7.0.2` - Persistent storage (already installed)

#### B. Created Mobile Notification Service
**File:** `frontend/src/services/mobileNotifications.ts`

**Features:**
- **Permission Request**: Automatically requests notification permission on first login
- **Polling System**: Checks for new messages every 30 seconds
- **Message Notifications**: Shows local notifications for new messages with sender name
- **Team Request Notifications**: Shows notifications for new team join requests
- **Native Platform Detection**: Only runs on Android/iOS, not web browser
- **Automatic Initialization**: Starts when user logs in, stops on logout
- **Persistent After Restart**: Resumes polling if user reopens app while logged in

**Polling Endpoints:**
- Messages: `GET /api/messages/recent?since=TIMESTAMP`
- Team Requests: `GET /api/matching/team-requests/pending`

#### C. Integrated with Auth System
**File:** `frontend/src/features/auth/AuthContext.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Calls `MobileNotificationService.initialize(token)` on login
- Calls `MobileNotificationService.initialize(token)` when loading stored session
- Calls `MobileNotificationService.stopPolling()` on logout

## Technical Details

### APK Information
- **Version**: Latest (built Oct 27, 2025)
- **File Size**: 9.3 MB (increased from 8.7 MB due to notification plugins)
- **Location**: `frontend/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
- **Package**: com.comeondost.app
- **Signing**: Signed with comeondost-release-key.jks

### Notification Permissions
The app now requests these Android permissions:
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - Display local notifications
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - Resume polling after device restart
- `VIBRATE` - Vibrate on notification (optional)

These are automatically added by the Capacitor plugins.

### Polling Behavior
- **Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Battery Impact**: Minimal (only API calls, no constant socket connection)
- **Data Usage**: ~1 KB per check (very low)
- **Background Limits**: Android may restrict after 10 minutes in background (Android 12+)

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Message Input
1. Open the app on emulator
2. Login and navigate to Messages
3. Select a chat
4. Tap the message input field
5. **Verify**: 
   - Input field expands properly
   - Emoji button is visible and not overlapping
   - Send button is properly sized
   - No horizontal scrolling
   - Keyboard doesn't hide the input

### 2. Test Notifications (Foreground)
1. Login to the app
2. Keep the app open
3. From another device/account, send a message to this user
4. Wait up to 30 seconds
5. **Verify**: Notification appears at the top of the screen

### 3. Test Notifications (Background)
1. Login to the app
2. Press Home button (app goes to background)
3. From another device/account, send a message to this user
4. Wait up to 30 seconds
5. **Verify**: 
   - Notification appears in notification tray
   - Shows sender name and message preview
   - Plays notification sound
   - Tapping notification opens the app

### 4. Test Team Request Notifications
1. Login as a contractor
2. Have another user send a team join request
3. Wait up to 30 seconds
4. **Verify**: "New Team Request" notification appears

## Backend Requirements

For notifications to work properly, the backend needs these endpoints:

### Required Endpoint (Missing):
```
GET /api/messages/recent?since=TIMESTAMP
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN

Response:
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "senderId": "uuid",
    "senderName": "John Doe",
    "content": "Hello!",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-27T06:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

### Existing Endpoint (Working):
```
GET /api/matching/team-requests/pending
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. Polling vs Push Notifications
- **Current**: Polls every 30 seconds (may have 30s delay)
- **Better**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for instant push notifications
- **Trade-off**: Polling is simpler, no FCM setup required

### 2. Android Background Restrictions
- **Android 12+**: Restricts background tasks after ~10 minutes
- **Solution**: Use FCM or ask users to disable battery optimization for the app
- **Alternative**: Increase polling interval when in background

### 3. Notification Details
- **Current**: Shows message sender and preview
- **Future**: Could add message actions (reply, archive, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
1. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**
   - Instant push notifications
   - Works even when app is closed
   - Battery efficient
   - Requires: Firebase project setup, backend integration

2. **Backend `/api/messages/recent` Endpoint**
   - Currently service polls but endpoint missing
   - Should return messages since given timestamp
   - Filter by recipient (current user)

### Medium Priority
3. **Notification Actions**
   - Quick reply from notification
   - Mark as read
   - Archive/delete

4. **Notification Grouping**
   - Group multiple messages from same sender
   - Show message count: "John Doe (3 messages)"

5. **Notification Settings**
   - Enable/disable notifications
   - Set quiet hours
   - Customize notification sound

### Low Priority
6. **Offline Message Queue**
   - Queue messages when offline
   - Send automatically when reconnected

7. **Read Receipts**
   - Show when message is read
   - Integrated with notifications

---

## Deployment

### Update Google Drive APK
1. Upload the new `app-release.apk` (9.3 MB) to Google Drive
2. Update the download link on the homepage
3. Update file size in the download button text

### Update Homepage
```tsx
<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_NEW_FILE_ID">
  <button>ðŸ“¥ Download APK (9.3 MB)</button>
</a>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing
1. **Check Permissions**: Settings > Apps > Come On Dost > Notifications (must be enabled)
2. **Check Battery**: Settings > Apps > Come On Dost > Battery > Unrestricted
3. **Check Logs**: `adb logcat | grep -i "notification\|comeondost"`
4. **Verify Login**: Must be logged in for notifications to work
5. **Check Backend**: Ensure `/api/messages/recent` endpoint exists and returns data

### Input Field Not Visible
1. **Check Screen Size**: Works best on screens â‰¥320px width
2. **Check CSS**: Verify ChatBubble.css has mobile breakpoints at @768px and @480px
3. **Check Keyboard**: Some Android keyboards may cover input - try different keyboard

### App Crashes on Login
1. **Check Token**: Ensure JWT token is valid
2. **Check Permissions**: App needs network permission
3. **Check Logs**: `adb logcat | grep -E "AndroidRuntime|FATAL"`
