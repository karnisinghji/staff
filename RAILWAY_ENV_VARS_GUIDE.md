# üöÄ Railway Environment Variables - Deployment Guide

## Required Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your Railway services through the Railway dashboard or CLI.

---

## Method 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

### Matching Service
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your **matching-service**
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Add the following:
   ```
   MIN_MATCH_SCORE=0
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
5. Click **Deploy** (service will auto-restart)

### Auth Service
1. Select your **auth-service**
2. Go to **Variables** tab
3. Add the following:
   ```
   BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
4. Click **Deploy**

### All Other Services (user-service, communication-service, notification-service)
1. Select each service
2. Add/verify:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

---

## Method 2: Railway CLI

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# Navigate to project
cd /Users/shouryaveersingh/Desktop/old\ data/staff
```

### Add Variables

#### Matching Service
```bash
cd backend/services/matching-service
railway link
railway variables set MIN_MATCH_SCORE=0
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Auth Service
```bash
cd backend/services/auth-service
railway link
railway variables set BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
```

#### User Service
```bash
cd backend/services/user-service
railway link
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Communication Service
```bash
cd backend/services/communication-service
railway link
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Notification Service
```bash
cd backend/services/notification-service
railway link
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
```

---

## Verification

After adding variables, verify they were set correctly:

```bash
# Check matching-service
cd backend/services/matching-service
railway variables

# Check auth-service
cd backend/services/auth-service
railway variables
```

Expected output should show:
- `MIN_MATCH_SCORE=0` (matching-service)
- `BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12` (auth-service)
- `NODE_ENV=production` (all services)

---

## What These Variables Do

### MIN_MATCH_SCORE (Matching Service)
- **Purpose**: Configurable minimum matching threshold
- **Default**: 0
- **Range**: 0-100
- **Impact**: Controls minimum score for contractor-worker matches
- **Fix**: Bug #9 - Makes matching threshold configurable

### BCRYPT_ROUNDS (Auth Service)
- **Purpose**: Password hashing strength
- **Default**: 12
- **Range**: 10-15 (higher = more secure, slower)
- **Impact**: Security - stronger password hashing
- **Fix**: Bug #13 - Increased from 10 to 12 rounds

### NODE_ENV (All Services)
- **Purpose**: Controls environment-specific behavior
- **Value**: `production`
- **Impact**: 
  - Hides error details from API responses (security)
  - Optimizes performance
  - Disables debug features
- **Fix**: Bug #5 - Environment-based error handling

---

## Deployment Impact

Once variables are added:
1. ‚úÖ Services will **automatically restart** with new configuration
2. ‚úÖ No code changes needed - variables are read at runtime
3. ‚úÖ Error details will be hidden in production (security)
4. ‚úÖ Password hashing will use 12 rounds (stronger)
5. ‚úÖ Matching threshold is now configurable

---

## Troubleshooting

### Variables not taking effect?
```bash
# Restart the service
railway restart --service <service-name>

# Or redeploy
railway up --detach --service <service-name>
```

### Check service logs
```bash
railway logs --service matching-service
railway logs --service auth-service
```

### Verify environment
```bash
# Check what environment variables are set
railway variables --service <service-name>
```

---

## Next Steps

After adding environment variables:
1. ‚úÖ Verify variables are set correctly
2. ‚úÖ Check service logs for successful restart
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Proceed to backend deployment (building services)
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Deploy frontend
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Test live application

---

**Status**: Environment variables configuration ready  
**Action Required**: Add variables via Railway Dashboard or CLI  
**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes
