# Govindgarh Location Addition

## Overview

Added Govindgarh to the supported locations in the matching service.

## Issue

Users in Govindgarh were unable to find contractors when using this location in the search, despite having workers with this location in the database.

## Root Cause

The matching service uses a geocoding system with predefined coordinates for Indian cities to calculate distances. Govindgarh was not included in this list, causing searches with this location to fall back to default coordinates or fail to find nearby contractors.

## Solution

Added Govindgarh to the `cityCoordinates` map in `location.ts` with the following coordinates:

```typescript
'govindgarh': { latitude: 26.5028, longitude: 76.9904 }
```

## Implementation Details

1. Updated `/backend/services/matching-service/src/utils/location.ts` to include Govindgarh
2. Added precise geocoordinates for Govindgarh (26.5028° N, 76.9904° E)
3. Redeployed the matching service to Railway

## Expected Results

Users in Govindgarh should now be able to:
- Find contractors when searching with "Govindgarh" as their location
- Receive distance-accurate results based on proper geocoding
- See contractors sorted by both distance and score

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:
1. Log in as a worker user
2. Enter "Govindgarh" in the location field on the search page
3. Ensure contractors are displayed in the results

## Additional Information

The location system currently supports over 75 Indian cities. If any other locations need to be added, follow the same pattern by adding them to the `cityCoordinates` map with accurate latitude and longitude coordinates.
