# 📱 APK Distribution via Google Drive - Setup Guide

## 🎯 The Problem

Firebase Hosting (free Spark plan) **doesn't allow executable files** like APK files. This is their security policy.

**Error you'll see:**
```
Executable files are forbidden on the Spark billing plan
```

## ✅ The Solution: Google Drive

Use Google Drive to host your APK - it's free, fast, and works perfectly!

---

## 📤 Step 1: Upload APK to Google Drive

### Option A: Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Go to Google Drive:** https://drive.google.com
2. **Click "New" → "File upload"**
3. **Select your APK:**
   ```
   /Users/shouryaveersingh/Desktop/old data/staff/frontend/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```
4. **Wait for upload to complete** (8.7 MB, ~30 seconds)

### Option B: Google Drive Desktop App

1. Open Google Drive folder on your Mac
2. Drag and drop `app-release.apk` into the folder
3. Wait for sync to complete

## 🔗 Step 2: Get Shareable Link

1. **Right-click the uploaded APK** in Google Drive
2. **Click "Get link" or "Share"**
3. **Change permissions:**
   - Click "Restricted" dropdown
   - Select **"Anyone with the link"**
   - Keep it as **"Viewer"** (they can download but not edit)
4. **Copy the link** - it will look like:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abc123xyz456/view?usp=sharing
   ```

### Extract the File ID

From this link:
```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abc123xyz456/view?usp=sharing
```

The File ID is: `1abc123xyz456` (the part between `/d/` and `/view`)

---

## 🔧 Step 3: Update Your Homepage Code

### Current Code (placeholder):
```tsx
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing"
```

### Replace with your actual link:
```tsx
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abc123xyz456/view?usp=sharing"
```

**File to edit:**
```
frontend/src/features/home/HomePage.tsx
Line ~30 (look for the APK download section)
```

### Quick Edit Command:
```bash
# Replace YOUR_FILE_ID with your actual ID
cd "/Users/shouryaveersingh/Desktop/old data/staff/frontend"
sed -i '' 's/YOUR_FILE_ID/1abc123xyz456/g' src/features/home/HomePage.tsx
```

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Rebuild & Deploy

```bash
cd "/Users/shouryaveersingh/Desktop/old data/staff/frontend"

# Build with updated link
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Deployment time:** ~1-2 minutes

---

## 📱 Step 5: Test the Download

1. **Visit your website:** https://comeondost.web.app
2. **Scroll to "Download Android App" section**
3. **Click "Download APK (8.7 MB)" button**
4. **Should redirect to Google Drive** 
5. **Click the download icon** (⬇️) at top of Google Drive page
6. **APK downloads** to your device!

### Mobile Testing:
On your Android phone:
1. Visit: https://comeondost.web.app
2. Click download button
3. Google Drive opens in browser
4. Tap download icon
5. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" when prompted

## 🎨 Optional: Use Direct Download Link

Google Drive has a direct download link format that skips the preview page:

### Standard Link (shows preview):
```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abc123xyz456/view?usp=sharing
```

### Direct Download Link:
```
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1abc123xyz456
```

**Pros:** Downloads immediately  
**Cons:** May show virus scan warning for large files

To use direct download, update HomePage.tsx:
```tsx
href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1abc123xyz456"
```

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Dropbox

If you prefer Dropbox:

1. **Upload APK to Dropbox**
2. **Click "Share" → "Create a link"**
3. **Copy the link** - looks like:
   ```
   https://www.dropbox.com/s/abc123xyz/app-release.apk?dl=0
   ```
4. **Change `?dl=0` to `?dl=1`** for direct download:
   ```
   https://www.dropbox.com/s/abc123xyz/app-release.apk?dl=1
   ```
5. **Update HomePage.tsx** with this link

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "This file is too large for Google to scan for viruses"
**Normal!** Google shows this for files >100 MB. Your APK is only 8.7 MB, so you won't see this.

### "Download Anyway" button appears
This means Google couldn't scan the APK. It's safe - click "Download Anyway".

### Users can't download - "You need access"
Your sharing permissions are still "Restricted". Go back and set to "Anyone with the link".

### APK won't install on phone
Make sure user enabled "Install from Unknown Sources" in Android settings.
