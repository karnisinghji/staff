## Critical Fixes Applied

**Problem:** `Cannot find type definition file for 'jest'`  
**Solution:** Removed `"jest"` from TypeScript types array (not needed for production)  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed in commit `5cadd69f`

### Fix #2: TypeScript @types Moved to Dependencies âœ…
**Problem:** `Could not find a declaration file for module 'express'` (and similar)  
**Solution:** Moved all `@types/*` packages from devDependencies to dependencies  
**Reason:** Render needs type definitions to compile TypeScript during build  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed in commit `50d314e6`

### Fix #3: Added TypeScript Compiler âœ…
**Added:** `typescript` package to all service dependencies  
**Reason:** Render needs the TypeScript compiler to build the project
