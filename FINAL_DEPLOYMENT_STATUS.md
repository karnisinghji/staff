### 🗄️ Database Connection: SUCCESS

- **Provider**: Neon PostgreSQL (Serverless)
- **Connection**: `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Status**: All services connected successfully
- **Schema**: Complete with all tables and relationships

### 🧪 Verified Functionality

**✅ Registration Test:**
- Endpoint: `POST https://staff-auth-service-gsg3.onrender.com/api/auth/register`
- Result: User created successfully with UUID
- Response: `{"id":"8cbeae85-f1c3-4e4c-9051-82eae0dccea5","email":"testuser4@example.com","roles":["worker"]}`

**✅ Login Test:**  
- Endpoint: `POST https://staff-auth-service-gsg3.onrender.com/api/auth/login`
- Result: JWT tokens generated successfully
- Response: Valid accessToken and refreshToken returned

### 🔧 Critical Issues Resolved

1. **Database Connection**: Fixed by implementing DATABASE_URL support instead of individual DB environment variables
2. **Schema Mismatch**: Updated auth service repository to match actual database schema (removed username column references)
3. **Environment Variables**: All services now properly load DATABASE_URL from Render environment
4. **SSL Configuration**: Added proper SSL configuration for production Neon connections

All services tested and verified locally:
