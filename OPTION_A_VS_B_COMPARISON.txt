🅰️ OPTION A: RAILWAY GITHUB INTEGRATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What It Is:
Native integration built into Railway platform. Railway watches your
GitHub repo and automatically builds/deploys when you push code.

How It Works:
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   You Push  │ ───> │   Railway   │ ───> │   Service   │
│  to GitHub  │      │   Detects   │      │   Deploys   │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘

Configuration:
- Done in Railway Dashboard (web UI)
- Click "Connect GitHub Repo" for each service
- Set root directory (e.g., backend/services/auth-service)
- Set build/start commands
- Done!

Deployment Process:
1. You: git push origin main
2. Railway: Detects push to repo
3. Railway: Checks "Watch Paths" for changes
4. Railway: If service files changed, triggers build
5. Railway: Builds on Railway servers
6. Railway: Deploys automatically
7. You: Check Railway dashboard for logs

Advantages:
✅ No configuration files in your repo
✅ No secrets to manage (Railway handles it)
✅ One-click rollback to previous deployment
✅ Built-in deployment preview (can test before making live)
✅ Deploy button for manual triggers
✅ Environment variables managed in Railway UI
✅ Zero maintenance (Railway handles everything)
✅ Separate logs per service
✅ Can pause/restart services easily
✅ Preview deployments for PRs (optional)

Disadvantages:
❌ Less control over build process
❌ Can't add custom testing steps
❌ Limited to Railway's build environment
❌ Vendor lock-in (tied to Railway)
❌ Can't see deployment config in code
❌ Each service configured separately (5 times)

Best For:
✓ Teams that want simplicity
✓ Projects that don't need complex CI/CD
✓ When Railway is your only deployment platform
✓ Quick prototypes and MVPs
✓ Small teams without DevOps expertise

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🅱️ OPTION B: GITHUB ACTIONS CI/CD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What It Is:
Custom CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. You write workflow files
that define exactly how to build, test, and deploy your services.

How It Works:
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   You Push  │ ───> │   GitHub    │ ───> │   Workflow  │ ───> │   Railway   │
│  to GitHub  │      │   Actions   │      │   Runs      │      │   Deploys   │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘

Configuration:
- Workflow files in .github/workflows/
- YAML format (deploy-backend-fixed.yml)
- Version controlled with your code
- Visible to whole team

Deployment Process:
1. You: git push origin main
2. GitHub: Detects push
3. GitHub Actions: Reads workflow file
4. GitHub Runner: Starts Ubuntu VM
5. Runner: Installs Node.js, dependencies
6. Runner: Builds shared library
7. Runner: Builds each service
8. Runner: Runs tests (if configured)
9. Runner: Installs Railway CLI
10. Runner: Authenticates with RAILWAY_TOKEN
11. Runner: Links to Railway project
12. Runner: Runs railway up
13. Railway: Deploys service
14. GitHub: Shows success/failure

Advantages:
✅ Full control over build process
✅ Can add custom testing steps
✅ Can add linting, security scans
✅ Configuration in code (version controlled)
✅ Same workflow for all services (matrix strategy)
✅ Can deploy to multiple platforms (Railway + others)
✅ Can add Slack/email notifications
✅ Can run integration tests before deploy
✅ Can add approval steps (manual review)
✅ Team can see/review workflow changes

Disadvantages:
❌ More complex setup
❌ Need to manage RAILWAY_TOKEN secret
❌ Need to update workflow when structure changes
❌ Harder to debug (check GitHub Actions logs)
❌ Uses GitHub Actions minutes (limited on free tier)
❌ Need to handle Railway project linking
❌ More moving parts (can break)
❌ Requires YAML knowledge

Best For:
✓ Teams with DevOps experience
✓ Projects needing complex CI/CD
✓ When deploying to multiple platforms
✓ Projects requiring extensive testing
✓ Large teams with code review processes
✓ When you need deployment history in code

💰 COST COMPARISON
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Option A (Railway Integration):
- Free on Railway Hobby tier
- No GitHub Actions minutes used
- 5 services × deployment time = Railway resources only

Option B (GitHub Actions):
