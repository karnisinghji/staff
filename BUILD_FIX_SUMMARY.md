# Communication and Notification Services Build Fix

## Issue Summary

The build for both Communication and Notification services was failing with the following error:
```
src/index.ts(2,26): error TS2306: File '/app/src/app.ts' is not a module.
```

This occurred because the `app.ts` files in both services were empty, causing the TypeScript compiler to fail during the Docker build process.

## Root Cause

The `app.ts` files for both services were somehow emptied, possibly during a previous debugging or deployment operation. Both files had `.bak` backup versions available which contained the complete code.

## Fix Implemented

1. Restored both `app.ts` files from their `.bak` backup versions
2. Preserved the CORS debugging additions that were previously made
3. Created a validation script (`file-restore-check.sh`) to ensure files were properly restored

## Files Fixed:

1. `/backend/services/communication-service/src/app.ts`
2. `/backend/services/notification-service/src/app.ts`

## Testing and Verification

After restoring the files:
1. Run `./file-restore-check.sh` to validate both files have been properly restored
2. Commit the changes
3. Push to GitHub to trigger a rebuild
4. Execute `./force-redeploy.sh` to ensure a clean deployment
5. Verify in Railway logs that the build completes successfully

## Impact

The build failure prevented the proper deployment of the CORS fixes that were previously implemented. With the `app.ts` files restored, the CORS configuration should now work as intended, allowing requests from all required frontend domains.

## Prevention Steps

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. When using debugging scripts that modify important files, always:
   - Create proper backups before modifications
   - Verify file integrity after modifications
   - Use version control to track changes

2. Consider implementing a pre-deployment validation step that checks:
   - File existence and minimum size for critical files
   - Successful TypeScript compilation before pushing to production
