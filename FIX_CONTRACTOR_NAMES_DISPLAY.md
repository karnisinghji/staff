# Fix: Contractor Names Not Showing in Search Results

## Problem

When searching for contractors, the results showed:
- ‚ùå "Worker c39dc3" instead of actual names
- ‚ùå "Worker cd0bcf" instead of "ABC Construction"
- ‚ùå "Worker 80655e" instead of "Ram Singh"

## Root Cause

The backend was returning contractor data with fields named `contractorName` and `companyName`, but the frontend expected `name` and `company`. The controller wasn't mapping these fields correctly.

**Backend returned:**
```json
{
  "contractorName": "Ram Singh",
  "companyName": "Ram Construction"
}
```

**Frontend expected:**
```json
{
  "name": "Ram Singh",
  "company": "Ram Construction"
}
```

## Solution

Added field mapping in `MatchingController.ts` for both contractors and workers:

### For Contractors (findContractors):
```typescript
const mappedContractors = contractors.map((c: any) => ({
    id: c.id,
    name: c.contractorName || c.companyName || `Contractor ${c.id?.slice(-6)}`,
    company: c.companyName,
    location: c.location,
    distanceKm: c.distanceKm,
    score: c.score,
    rating: c.rating,
    totalProjects: c.totalProjects,
    needWorkerStatus: c.needWorkerStatus,
    email: c.email,
    skills: c.skillsNeeded || []
}));
```

### For Workers (findWorkers):
```typescript
const mappedWorkers = workers.map((w: any) => ({
    id: w.id,
    name: w.workerName || `Worker ${w.id?.slice(-6)}`,
    location: w.location,
    distanceKm: w.distanceKm,
    score: w.score,
    rating: w.rating,
    totalJobs: w.totalJobs,
    hourlyRate: w.hourlyRate,
    experienceYears: w.experienceYears,
    bio: w.bio,
    isAvailable: w.isAvailable,
    skills: w.skills || []
}));
```

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `backend/services/matching-service/src/controllers/MatchingController.ts`
  - Added mapping for `findContractors` response (lines 188-201)
  - Added mapping for `findWorkers` response (lines 112-125)

## Deployment

‚úÖ Deployed to Railway:
```bash
cd backend/services/matching-service
railway up --detach
```

Service URL: https://matching-service-production.up.railway.app
Status: ‚úÖ Running (uptime: 9375 seconds)

## Testing

### Test as Worker (searching for contractors):

1. **Login** as worker (Karni or Chanchal)
2. **Go to Search** ‚Üí "Find Job Opportunities"
3. **Search**: Location = "Govindgarh", Distance = 50km
4. **Expected Results**: Should now see real names:
   - ‚úÖ "ABC Construction" (not "Worker c39dc3")
   - ‚úÖ "Ram Singh" (not "Worker cd0bcf")
   - ‚úÖ "Home Renovations Plus" (not "Worker 80655e")
   - ‚úÖ "Manoj" (not "Worker ae05")
   - etc.

### Test as Contractor (searching for workers):

1. **Login** as contractor (Ram)
2. **Go to Search** ‚Üí "Find Skilled Workers"
3. **Search**: Skill = "electrician", Location = "Govindgarh", Distance = 50km
4. **Expected Results**: Should show worker names:
   - ‚úÖ "Chanchal Palawat"
   - ‚úÖ "Narendra Sharma"
   - ‚úÖ "Shyam Singh"
   - ‚úÖ "Hari Singh"
   - ‚úÖ "Karni Singh (Arshka)"

## Verification

**Before Fix:**
```
Worker c39dc3
Individual Contractor
‡§ó‡•ã‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§ó‡§¢, Rajasthan, India
```

**After Fix:**
```
ABC Construction
Individual Contractor  (or company name)
‡§ó‡•ã‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§ó‡§¢, Rajasthan, India
```

All contractor names should now display properly! üéâ
