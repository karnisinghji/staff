# üöÄ ALL SERVICE BUILD ISSUES FIXED!

## ‚úÖ UUID Dependency Issues Resolved

**Fixed Services:**
- ‚úÖ **Notification Service** - Added `@types/uuid` and `uuid` dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Communication Service** - Added `@types/uuid` and `uuid` dependencies  
- ‚úÖ **Auth Service** - Already had UUID dependencies (working)

**Build Error Fixed:**
```
error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'uuid'
```

## üîÑ Current Deployment Status

### **Services Redeploying with Fixes:**
- ‚è≥ **Notification Service** - Redeploying with UUID fix
- ‚è≥ **Communication Service** - Redeploying with UUID fix

### **Services Already Live:**
- ‚úÖ **Auth Service** - Live at https://staff-auth-service-gsg3.onrender.com
- ‚úÖ **User Service** - Live at https://staff-user-service.onrender.com
- ‚úÖ **Matching Service** - Live at https://staff-matching-service.onrender.com

## üö® CRITICAL: Environment Variables Still Needed

All 5 services still need these environment variables for database/auth to work:

```env
JWT_SECRET=contractor-worker-platform-super-secret-key-2025
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CORS_ORIGIN=https://karnisinghji.github.io
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://karnisinghji.github.io,http://localhost:5173
```

**Services needing these variables:**
1. staff-auth-service-gsg3
2. staff-user-service
3. staff-matching-service
4. staff-communication-service-cdqt (after redeploy completes)
5. staff-notification-service (after redeploy completes)

## ‚è∞ Timeline

### **Next 5 minutes:**
- Communication and Notification services finish redeploying
- All 5 services will have working health endpoints

### **After adding environment variables:**
- Registration/login endpoints will work
- Database connections will succeed
- Full application functionality restored

## üéØ Next Actions

1. **Wait** for communication and notification services to finish redeploying
2. **Add environment variables** to all 5 services
3. **Manual redeploy** each service after adding variables
4. **Test registration** - should work perfectly!

**We're almost there!** All build issues are resolved. Just need environment variables for full functionality. üöÄ
