## 🎯 User Request

> "can you open it here and debug: https://karnisinghji.github.io/staff/  
> i found that it not working connecting properly with backend.  
> and also solve below:  
> - GitHub Pages Cache: Takes 5-10 minutes to update (normal)  
> - Registration: Needs username field added to frontend form"

---

## 🔍 Issues Found

### 1. Database Schema Issue ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
```
Error: null value in column "username" of relation "users" violates not-null constraint
```

**Root Cause:**
- Database table `users` has a `username` column with NOT NULL constraint
- Backend repository (`PgCredentialRepository`) was not inserting value into username field
- Every registration attempt failed with this constraint violation

**Solution:**
- Modified `backend/services/auth-service/src/hexagon/infrastructure/adapters/PgCredentialRepository.ts`
- Added `username` field to INSERT statement
- Set `username = email/phone` (the identifier from registration)
- Updated `findByEmail()` to also search by username field

**Commit:** `7cc8919c`

---

### 2. GitHub Pages Cache Issue ⏳ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- GitHub Pages serving old JavaScript bundle (index-P90yXLtf.js)
- New build not being loaded immediately

**Solution:**
- Added cache-busting HTTP headers to `frontend/index.html`:
  ```html
  <meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" />
  <meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache" />
  <meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0" />
  ```
- Rebuilt and redeployed frontend

**Commit:** `f086ee9c`

**Note:** GitHub Pages CDN takes 5-10 minutes to propagate, this is normal behavior

   - Returns user object with id and roles
   
2. **Login:**
   - User enters credentials
   - Frontend sends to `/api/auth/login`
   - Backend validates and generates JWT tokens
   - Returns access token, refresh token, and user object

### ✅ All Services Operational
- ✅ Auth Service: Registration, Login, JWT tokens
- ✅ User Service: Health check responding
- ✅ Matching Service: Health check responding
- ✅ Communication Service: Health check responding

## 🔄 GitHub Pages Cache Status

### Current State
- Old bundle: `index-P90yXLtf.js` (still being served)
- New bundle: `index-B1n6AmSD.js` (deployed, waiting for CDN)

### Expected Timeline
- **0-5 minutes:** Some users see new version
- **5-10 minutes:** Most users see new version
- **10-15 minutes:** All users see new version

### Force Cache Clear (User Side)
Users can bypass cache by:
1. **Hard Refresh:**
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

2. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Clear Data
   - Safari: Develop → Empty Caches

3. **Incognito/Private Mode:**
   - Opens with fresh cache
   - Best for immediate testing
