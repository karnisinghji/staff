## 📊 **Service Status:**

| Service | Status | URL |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **user-service** | ✅ **ONLINE** | https://user-service-production-f141.up.railway.app |
| **auth-service** | ✅ ONLINE | https://auth-service-production-d5c8.up.railway.app |
| **matching-service** | ✅ ONLINE | https://matching-service-production.up.railway.app |
| **Frontend** | ✅ ONLINE | https://comeondost.web.app |

---

## 🎯 **What Was Happening:**

1. **User opens search page** at https://comeondost.web.app/search
2. **Frontend tries to load skills** from `/api/users/skills`
3. **User-service was down** → 502 error
4. **Skills dropdown shows**: "Loading skills..." (stuck)
5. **User cannot select skills** → Search doesn't work properly

---

## 🔧 **What's Fixed Now:**

1. ✅ **User-service restarted** and healthy
2. ✅ **Skills endpoint working** - Returns 7 skill types
3. ✅ **Search page functional** - Skills dropdown loads
4. ✅ **Workers can search contractors** with skill filter
5. ✅ **Contractors can search workers** with skill filter

---

## 🧪 **Test It:**

1. Go to **https://comeondost.web.app/search**
2. **Skills dropdown** should now show:
   ```
   Select a skill...
   - Carpenter
   - Electrician
   - Laborer
   - Mason
   - Other
   - Painter
   - Plumber
   ```
3. **Select a skill** and search → Should work! ✨

## 📝 **Note About Health Endpoint:**

The user-service health endpoint returns plain text `"OK"` instead of JSON. This is different from other services that return:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "user-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

**Recommendation**: Update user-service health endpoint to match the standard format used by other services (see `backend/docs/HEALTH-METRICS.md`).

## 🔄 **If This Happens Again:**

### **Quick Fix:**
```bash
cd backend/services/user-service
railway up
```

### **Check if it worked:**
```bash
curl https://user-service-production-f141.up.railway.app/api/users/skills
# Should return JSON with skill list
```

### **Restart all services:**
```bash
# If multiple services are down
cd backend/services/auth-service && railway up &
cd backend/services/user-service && railway up &
cd backend/services/matching-service && railway up &
```

## ✅ **Current Status: ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL** 🚀
