# üîß Notification Service Build Fix Applied

## ‚úÖ Problem Solved

**Issue**: Notification service failing to build with:
```
error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'uuid'
```

**Solution Applied**: Added missing dependencies to `notification-service/package.json`:
- ‚úÖ `@types/uuid: ^9.0.7` (TypeScript type definitions)
- ‚úÖ `uuid: ^9.0.1` (Runtime UUID library)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. **Automatic Redeploy in Progress**
- Render will automatically redeploy notification service with the fix
- Build should now succeed (2-3 minutes)

### 2. **While Waiting - Add Missing Environment Variables**

All services still need these additional environment variables:

```env
JWT_SECRET=contractor-worker-platform-super-secret-key-2025
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CORS_ORIGIN=https://karnisinghji.github.io
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://karnisinghji.github.io,http://localhost:5173
```

**Services to configure:**
- staff-auth-service-gsg3
- staff-user-service
- staff-matching-service
- staff-communication-service-cdqt
- staff-notification-service (after it finishes redeploying)

### 3. **Manual Redeploy Required After Adding Variables**

After adding environment variables, manually redeploy each service to pick up the new configuration.

### 4. **Test Registration**

Once all services have the complete environment variables:

```bash
curl -X POST https://staff-auth-service-gsg3.onrender.com/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!","roles":["worker"]}'
```

## üìä Current Status

- ‚úÖ **4/5 services** have working health endpoints
- ‚úÖ **1/5 services** (notification) is redeploying with uuid fix
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **0/5 services** have complete environment variables
- ‚ùå **Database connections** still failing due to missing JWT_SECRET and other vars

**Next Priority**: Add the missing environment variables to all services! üéØ
