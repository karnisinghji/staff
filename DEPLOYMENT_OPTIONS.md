# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Strategy - Individual Services

## ðŸŽ¯ **The Issue**
Railway can't detect the build plan because we have a monorepo. Railway works best when deploying individual services separately.

## âœ… **Solution: Deploy Each Service Individually**

### **Method 1: Use Railway CLI (Recommended)**

1. **Install Railway CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
```

2. **Deploy Each Service:**
```bash
# Auth Service
cd backend/services/auth-service
railway up

# User Service  
cd ../user-service
railway up

# Matching Service
cd ../matching-service
railway up

# Communication Service
cd ../communication-service
railway up

# Notification Service
cd ../notification-service
railway up
```

### **Method 2: Create Individual GitHub Repos**
If CLI doesn't work, we can create separate repos for each service:

1. Create 5 separate GitHub repositories
2. Copy each service to its own repo
3. Deploy each repo separately on Railway

### **Method 3: Use Alternative Platform**
- **Render**: Better monorepo support
- **Railway Pro**: Has better monorepo features
- **Heroku**: Classic platform with good monorepo support

## ðŸŽ¯ **Which Method Do You Prefer?**

**A** - Try Railway CLI deployment  
**B** - Create separate GitHub repos  
**C** - Use Render instead  
**D** - Use Heroku
