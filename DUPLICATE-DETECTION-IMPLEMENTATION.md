# Duplicate Email/Phone Detection Implementation

## ✅ Completed Features

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. **Auth Service - Duplicate Detection**
Location: `/backend/services/auth-service/`

**Enhanced Error Codes:**
- `EMAIL_TAKEN` - When email already exists
- `PHONE_TAKEN` - When phone number already exists  
- `USERNAME_TAKEN` - When username (email or phone) already exists
- `DUPLICATE_USER` - Generic duplicate error

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hexagon/infrastructure/adapters/PgCredentialRepository.ts`
  - Added PostgreSQL constraint violation detection (error code 23505)
  - Returns specific errors based on which constraint was violated
  - Differentiates between username, email, and phone duplicates

- `src/hexagon/application/use-cases/RegisterUserUseCase.ts`
  - Checks if identifier is phone number vs email
  - Throws appropriate error before database operation

- `src/http/routes.ts`
  - Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Returns structured error responses with error codes

#### 2. **User Service - Profile Update Duplicate Detection**
Location: `/backend/services/user-service/`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hexagon/application/ports/UserRepository.ts`
  - Added `email` and `address` to UpdateUserFields interface

- `src/hexagon/infrastructure/db/PgRepositories.ts`
  - Added email and address update support
  - Detects duplicate email/phone on profile updates
  - Throws ConflictError with descriptive messages

- `src/controllers/UserController.ts`
  - Allows users to update their email (not just admins)
  - Maintains admin-only restriction for username changes

### Frontend Implementation

#### 3. **Register Page - Toast Notifications**
Location: `/frontend/src/features/auth/RegisterPage.tsx`

**Features Added:**
- ✅ Toast notifications for duplicate email
- ✅ Toast notifications for duplicate phone number
- ✅ Toast notifications for duplicate username
- ✅ Network error toast notifications
- ✅ Success toast notification on registration

**Error Messages:**
- "This email is already registered!"
- "This phone number is already registered!"
- Custom error messages based on error code

#### 4. **Profile Page - Toast Notifications**
Location: `/frontend/src/features/profile/ProfilePage.tsx`

**Features Added:**
- ✅ Toast notifications when updating to existing email
- ✅ Toast notifications when updating to existing phone
- ✅ Field-specific error highlighting
- ✅ Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

**Error Messages:**
- "This email is already in use by another account."
- "This phone number is already in use by another account."

## 📋 How It Works

### Registration Flow

```
User tries to register with email/phone
           ↓
Frontend sends request to /api/auth/register
           ↓
Backend validation (zod schema)
           ↓
RegisterUserUseCase checks for existing user
           ↓
If exists: Return error code (EMAIL_TAKEN/USERNAME_TAKEN)
           ↓
Frontend receives error response
           ↓
Toast notification appears (top-right corner)
           ↓
Error message displayed in form
```

### Profile Update Flow

```
User updates email/phone in profile
           ↓
Frontend sends PUT request to /api/users/profile
           ↓
Backend validation
           ↓
PgUserRepository.updateUser attempts update
           ↓
If duplicate constraint: PostgreSQL returns error 23505
           ↓
Repository throws ConflictError
           ↓
Controller returns 409 status with error message
           ↓
Frontend receives error response
           ↓
Toast notification appears
           ↓
Field-specific error highlighting
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Test Script
Location: `/test-duplicate-detection.js`

**Tests Performed:**
1. ✅ Register with email - Success
2. ✅ Register with same email - Correctly rejected (EMAIL_TAKEN)
3. ✅ Register with phone - Success
4. ✅ Register with same phone - Correctly rejected (USERNAME_TAKEN)
5. ✅ Update to existing email - Correctly rejected (CONFLICT)

### Test Results
```
✅ Registration duplicate detection: Working
✅ Error codes properly returned: Working
✅ Profile update duplicate detection: Working
🎉 All tests passed!
```

## 🎨 User Experience

### Toast Notification Features
- **Position:** Top-right corner
- **Auto-close:** 3 seconds (success), 5 seconds (error)
- **Colors:** 
  - Green for success
  - Red for errors
- **Actions:** 
  - Clickable to dismiss
  - Pausable on hover

### Error Display
1. **Toast Notification** - Appears temporarily at top-right
2. **Inline Error** - Shows below the input field
3. **Field Highlighting** - Input border turns red

## 📊 Error Code Reference

| Error Code | Scenario | Message |
|------------|----------|---------|
| `EMAIL_TAKEN` | Email already registered | "This email is already registered" |
| `PHONE_TAKEN` | Phone already registered | "This phone number is already registered" |
| `USERNAME_TAKEN` | Username (email/phone) exists | "This [email/phone] is already registered" |
| `DUPLICATE_USER` | Generic duplicate | "This email or phone number is already registered" |
| `CONFLICT` | Profile update duplicate | "This [email/phone] is already in use by another account" |

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **No User Enumeration:** Error messages don't reveal if account exists during login
2. **Validation:** Input validated on both frontend and backend
3. **Constraint Enforcement:** Database-level unique constraints prevent duplicates
4. **Error Codes:** Structured error codes prevent information leakage

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add rate limiting for registration attempts
- [ ] Implement email verification before allowing registration
- [ ] Add phone number verification via SMS/OTP
- [ ] Show "Did you mean to login?" link when duplicate detected
- [ ] Add animation to toast notifications
- [ ] Implement toast queue for multiple errors

## 📝 Summary

This implementation provides comprehensive duplicate detection with excellent user experience through toast notifications. Users receive immediate, clear feedback when they attempt to use an email or phone number that's already registered, both during registration and profile updates.

The system properly differentiates between email and phone number duplicates, providing context-specific error messages that guide users to take the appropriate action.
