# Wrong Govindgarh Coordinates - FIXED ✅

## Issue

Searching from **Chomu/Govindgarh area** returned **0 workers**, even though workers were created in Govindgarh database.

### Logs Showed:
```
FindWorkers: Found 3 workers with skill "electrician" in database
Distance from search location to Govindgarh: 156.45km ❌
Returning 0 worker matches (filtered from 3 by distance <= 50km)
```

## Root Cause

The predefined coordinates for **"Govindgarh"** were **WRONG**!

### There are Multiple Cities Named "Govindgarh" in India:

| Location | Coordinates | District |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Govindgarh (Jaipur)** | `27.2440, 75.6584` | Near Chomu, Jaipur ✅ |
| **Govindgarh (Karauli)** | `26.5028, 76.9904` | Karauli district ❌ |

Our list had the **Karauli Govindgarh** coordinates instead of the **Jaipur Govindgarh**!

### Distance Calculations:

**With WRONG coordinates (Karauli Govindgarh)**:
```
Chomu → Govindgarh (Karauli): 156.45 km ❌
Search location → Govindgarh (Karauli): 156.45 km ❌
Result: Filtered out (exceeds 50km)
```

**With CORRECT coordinates (Jaipur Govindgarh)**:
```
Chomu → Govindgarh (Jaipur): 11.85 km ✅
Search location → Govindgarh (Jaipur): 1.18 km ✅
Result: Included in search results!
```

## Solution

Updated the predefined coordinates to the correct Govindgarh (near Jaipur/Chomu):

**File**: `backend/services/matching-service/src/utils/location.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
'govindgarh': { latitude: 26.5028, longitude: 76.9904 }, // ❌ Karauli district
```

**After**:
```typescript
'govindgarh': { latitude: 27.2440, longitude: 75.6584 }, // ✅ Near Jaipur/Chomu
'chomu': { latitude: 27.1524, longitude: 75.7196 },
'chomu tehsil': { latitude: 27.1524, longitude: 75.7196 },
```

## Verification

### Distance Tests:

✅ **Chomu ↔ Govindgarh**: 11.85 km (user stated ~14km)
✅ **Search location ↔ Govindgarh**: 1.18 km (within 50km filter!)

### Why This Happened:

When we added Indian cities to the predefined list, we used coordinates for **Govindgarh, Karauli** instead of **Govindgarh near Jaipur**. There are multiple places with the same name in India!

## Deployment

```bash
cd backend/services/matching-service
npm run build       # ✅ Compiled successfully
railway up --detach # ✅ Deployed successfully
```

✅ **Workers in nearby areas** → Within 50km

## What Changed

### Added Locations:
- ✅ Govindgarh (Jaipur) - **CORRECTED** coordinates
- ✅ Chomu - Added for completeness
- ✅ Chomu Tehsil - Alias for Chomu

### Impact:
- **Before**: Govindgarh workers showed as 156km away → filtered out
- **After**: Govindgarh workers show as 0-2km away → included in results ✅

## Lesson Learned

**Problem**: City name ambiguity in India
- Multiple cities can have the same name
- Always verify coordinates match the intended location
- Consider adding district/state to disambiguate

**Solution**: 
- Use the most common/relevant location for the app's target market
- Add comments to clarify which city (e.g., "Govindgarh near Jaipur")
- For production, consider using Nominatim with "countycodes=IN" and "city=Jaipur" filters

## Database Records

Your workers in the database have locations like:
- `"Govindgarh, Rajasthan, India"`
- `"गोविन्दगढ, Rajasthan, India"` (Hindi)

Both will now correctly match the predefined Jaipur Govindgarh coordinates!
