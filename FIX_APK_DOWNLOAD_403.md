---

## Why Firebase Hosting Didn't Work

Firebase **Spark (free) plan** blocks executable files like APK:
- Error: "Executable files are forbidden on the Spark billing plan"
- Would need to upgrade to **Blaze plan** (pay-as-you-go)
- Google Drive is free and works perfectly for this use case

## Alternative Solutions (If Google Drive Has Issues)

### Option 1: GitHub Releases (Professional)
```bash
# Create a release on GitHub

```

### Option 2: Netlify (Free hosting)
- Sign up at netlify.com
- Drag & drop APK file
- Get direct download link

### Option 3: Dropbox (Free)
- Upload APK
- Get share link
- Change `?dl=0` to `?dl=1` at end of URL

## Future Updates

When you build a new APK:
1. Upload to same Google Drive file (replace it)
2. Link stays the same - no website changes needed
3. Users automatically get latest version

Or use this command to update:
```bash
# Build APK
cd frontend/android && ./gradlew assembleRelease

# APK will be at:
# frontend/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Upload to Google Drive manually or use gdrive CLI
```
