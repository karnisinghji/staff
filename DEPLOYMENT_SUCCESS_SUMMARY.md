## 🐛 Fixes Deployed

### 1. Same-Role Team Bug ✅
**Problem**: Contractors could team with contractors  
**Solution**: Added role validation in backend  
**Result**: Same-role team requests now blocked with clear error messages

### 2. Map Modal Fix ✅
**Problem**: Map not opening, showing setView errors  
**Solution**: Added unique key prop, enhanced coordinate validation  
**Result**: Map should now open smoothly with proper markers

---

## 📋 What You Should See Now

### "No team members found" Message
This is **CORRECT** if:
- ✅ You're logged in as a user who had only invalid (same-role) team members
- ✅ Those invalid relationships were removed in cleanup
- ✅ You haven't added any new valid (opposite-role) team members yet

### Ram's Account Specifically
**Before Cleanup**:
- ❌ Showed Manoj (contractor) - WRONG!
- ✅ Showed workers - correct

**After Cleanup (Now)**:
- ✅ Does NOT show Manoj - correct!
- ✅ Only shows workers (if any exist)

---

## 🧪 How to Verify Everything Works

### Test 1: Hard Refresh Browser ⚡
**Mac**:
- Chrome: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Safari: `Cmd + Option + R`

This clears the cache and loads the new code (SavedMatchesPage-TpD1z-AJ.js instead of old SavedMatchesPage-Baj5PufL.js)

### Test 2: Login as Ram (Contractor)
```
Email: ramp@info.com
Password: [your password]
```

**Navigate to**: My Team page

**Expected**:
- ✅ Manoj should NOT appear in list
- ✅ Only workers shown (or "No team members" if none)
- ✅ "Available Work Opportunities" section does NOT show
- ✅ Distance badges (📍 X.X km) for workers with GPS
- ✅ Contact buttons (📞) for workers with phone numbers
- ✅ "View on Map" buttons (🗺️) for workers with GPS

### Test 3: Try Same-Role Team Request
While logged in as Ram (contractor):

1. Search for workers or browse contractors
2. Try to send team request to another contractor
3. **Expected Result**: Error message appears
4. **Error Message**: "Contractors can only send team requests to workers, not other contractors"

### Test 4: Map Modal Test (with valid team member)
If Ram has any workers in his team with GPS:

1. Click "View on Map" button
2. **Expected**: Modal opens smoothly (no errors in console)
3. **Expected**: Map renders with:
   - Blue marker for worker
   - Green marker for Ram (contractor)
   - Orange dashed line between them
   - Distance in header
   - "Get Directions" button
4. Click "Get Directions"
5. **Expected**: Opens Google Maps in new tab

### Test 5: Add Valid Team Member
To test the full flow:

1. Login as Ram (contractor)
2. Search for a worker (e.g., Ravi Singh)
3. Send team request to worker
4. Logout
5. Login as that worker
6. Accept the team request
7. Both should now see each other in "My Team"
8. Both should see distance badges
9. Both should be able to click "View on Map"

## 🚨 If You Still See Errors

### Map Still Not Opening?
1. **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh (Cmd + Shift + R)
2. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console tab):
   - Look for: "LocationMapModal opened with data:"
   - Should NOT see: "Invalid LatLng object: (NaN, NaN)"
3. **Check coordinate values**: Worker must have valid GPS coordinates

### Still Seeing Old SavedMatchesPage-Baj5PufL.js?
- Clear browser cache completely
- Try incognito/private mode
- Check Network tab to confirm new file loaded: SavedMatchesPage-TpD1z-AJ.js

### Still Seeing Manoj in Ram's Team?
This shouldn't happen, but if it does:
1. Backend might not be fully deployed
2. Check Railway logs for errors
3. Verify database cleanup worked by running:
```sql
SELECT * FROM team_members tm
JOIN users u1 ON tm.user_id = u1.id
JOIN users u2 ON tm.team_member_id = u2.id
WHERE u1.role = u2.role;
-- Should return 0 rows
```
