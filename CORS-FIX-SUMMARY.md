# CORS Fix Summary for All Services

## Issues Fixed
- Fixed CORS configuration for all backend services to allow requests from the frontend at https://comeondost.web.app
- Identified code issues in Communication and Notification services that require app.ts modifications

## Environment Variable Changes
Updated CORS environment variables in Railway for all services:
```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://karnisinghji.github.io,https://comeondost.web.app,https://comeondost.netlify.app,http://localhost:5173
CORS_ORIGINS=https://karnisinghji.github.io,https://comeondost.web.app,https://comeondost.netlify.app,http://localhost:5173
CORS_ORIGIN=https://comeondost.web.app
```

## Services Status

| Service | Environment Variables Updated | Redeployed | Working Correctly | Notes |
|---------|------------------------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Auth Service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Fully functional |
| User Service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Already working correctly |
| Matching Service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Fully functional |
| Communication Service | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Needs code changes in app.ts |
| Notification Service | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Needs code changes in app.ts |

## Code Issues Found
Communication and Notification services have hardcoded CORS origin lists in their app.ts files that override the environment variables. See `CORS_CODE_FIX_PLAN.md` for detailed fix instructions.

## Testing Tools Created
1. `test-matching-cors.js` - Tests CORS for the matching service
2. `test-all-services-cors.js` - Comprehensive CORS test for all services and domains

## Next Steps
1. Implement code changes in Communication and Notification services as described in `CORS_CODE_FIX_PLAN.md`
2. Commit and push changes to trigger Railway redeployment
3. Verify all services using the test scripts
