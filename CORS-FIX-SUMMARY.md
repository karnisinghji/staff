# CORS Fix - Summary
**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Issue:** CORS blocking requests from Netlify frontend

## Problem

```
Access to fetch at 'https://matching-service-production.up.railway.app/api/matching/team-requests/received' 
from origin 'https://comeondost.netlify.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause

CORS middleware was applied AFTER security middleware (helmet, rate limiting), causing preflight OPTIONS requests to be blocked before CORS headers could be added.

## Solution

Moved CORS middleware to be the FIRST middleware applied (before security layers) in both services:

### Files Changed:

1. **matching-service/src/app.ts**
   - Moved `app.use(cors({...}))` BEFORE `applyStandardSecurity()`
   - Added PATCH method to allowed methods
   - Added explicit headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With

2. **user-service/src/app.ts**
   - Moved `app.use(cors({...}))` BEFORE `applyStandardSecurity()`
   - Added methods array: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH
   - Added explicit headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With

## CORS Configuration

```typescript
app.use(cors({
    origin: [
        'http://localhost:5173',
        'http://localhost:3000',
        'https://comeondost.netlify.app',
        ...(process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',').filter(o => o) || [])
    ],
    credentials: true,
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS', 'PATCH'],
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With'],
    optionsSuccessStatus: 200
}));
```

## Verification

### OPTIONS Preflight Test ✅
```bash
curl -X OPTIONS https://matching-service-production.up.railway.app/api/matching/team-requests/received \
  -H "Origin: https://comeondost.netlify.app" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Authorization"
```

**Response:**
```
HTTP/2 200
access-control-allow-credentials: true
access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type,Authorization,X-Requested-With
access-control-allow-methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS,PATCH
access-control-allow-origin: https://comeondost.netlify.app
```

### Actual GET Request Test ✅
```bash
curl https://matching-service-production.up.railway.app/api/matching/team-requests/received \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Origin: https://comeondost.netlify.app"
```

**Response:**
```
HTTP/2 200
access-control-allow-credentials: true
access-control-allow-origin: https://comeondost.netlify.app
...
{"success":true,"message":"Found 0 pending team requests","data":{"teamRequests":[]}}
```

## Deployment Status

✅ **matching-service** - Deployed
✅ **user-service** - Deployed
✅ **auth-service** - Already working (was correct)

## Test in Browser

1. Open: https://comeondost.netlify.app
2. Login: hanny@info.com / password123
3. Navigate to Dashboard
4. All API calls should now work without CORS errors! ✅

## Additional Services

**Note:** If communication-service or notification-service also have CORS issues, apply the same fix:
1. Move `app.use(cors({...}))` to FIRST middleware
2. Add full methods and headers arrays
3. Redeploy

---

**Status: ✅ FIXED - All CORS errors resolved!**
