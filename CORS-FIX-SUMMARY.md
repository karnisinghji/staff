# CORS Fix Summary for All Services

## Issues Fixed
- Fixed CORS configuration for all backend services to allow requests from the frontend at https://comeondost.web.app
- Created automated script `fix-cors-new.sh` to streamline CORS updates for all services
- Successfully resolved 403 Forbidden error in matching-service

## Environment Variable Changes
Updated CORS environment variables in Railway for all services:
```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://comeondost.web.app,https://comeondost.firebaseapp.com,http://localhost:5173
CORS_ORIGINS=https://comeondost.web.app,https://comeondost.firebaseapp.com,http://localhost:5173
```

## Latest Update (October 13, 2025)
We've created and run a new script `fix-cors-new.sh` that:
1. Updates CORS environment variables for all services
2. Redeploys each service to apply changes immediately
3. Confirms successful CORS configuration through preflight testing

## Services Status

| Service | Environment Variables Updated | Redeployed | Working Correctly | Notes |
|---------|------------------------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Auth Service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Fully functional |
| User Service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Working correctly |
| Matching Service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | CORS issue now fixed |
| Communication Service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Successfully updated |
| Notification Service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Successfully updated |

## Verification Method
We verified the CORS configuration using the `test-cors.sh` script which sends a preflight OPTIONS request to the matching service. The response now includes:

```
access-control-allow-credentials: true
access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type,Authorization,X-Requested-With
access-control-allow-methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS,PATCH
access-control-allow-origin: https://comeondost.web.app
```

## Testing Tools Created
1. `test-cors.sh` - Tests CORS preflight requests for the matching service
2. `api-test.html` - Browser-based testing tool for all services
3. `test-api-connection.sh` - Terminal-based API testing tool

## Implementation Notes
The automated script approach proved more efficient than manual updates, as it:
1. Ensures consistent configuration across all services
2. Handles the Railway CLI login and project selection
3. Automatically redeploys services to apply changes
4. Provides detailed progress updates and error reporting

## Next Steps
1. Monitor for any remaining CORS issues in production use
2. Update deployment scripts to include proper CORS configuration by default
3. Consider integrating CORS environment variables into CI/CD pipeline

## Maintenance Notes
If you need to update CORS origins in the future:
1. Modify the `fix-cors-new.sh` script with new origins
2. Run the script to update and redeploy all services
3. Verify with `test-cors.sh` that changes are applied correctly
